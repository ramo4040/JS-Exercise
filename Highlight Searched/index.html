                                In JavaScript, a class is a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with
                                code to work on that data. Classes in JavaScript are built on prototypes but also have
                                some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes 12.
                                Classes were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to provide a cleaner way to follow
                                object-oriented programming patterns. Before classes, developers used constructor
                                functions to implement OOP in JavaScript. Now, with the introduction of classes, it has
                                become easier for developers to build software around OOP concepts 4.
                                A class is declared using the class keyword, followed by the class name and a pair of
                                curly braces {}. Inside the curly braces, you can define properties and methods 2.
